City Planning for City Build 2 (Nebulian Wayland 8, Orionian Wayland 2, XOHR City... 4? 5? (XOHR was a mess anyway so whatever))

Greetings life form!
If you've found this file, congrats, and welcome to the headquarters of the team who's working on building the City

## Collaboration
If you want to help, open an issue using the "Write Access" template and I'll see about adding you as a contributor/collaborator on this GitHub repo.
I (Jes'kad), will ask you some questions, and determine if you need/are allowed access to create, edit and add on to the files, or if we merely need to merge your ideas into the files ourselves.

## In-Game Building
Previously we brought people on-board as they asked to be brought on, but now we're doing it different. Kaddicus of course has access to the City, and is the main Builder. There's currently no Second in Command. Staff and VIPs have access but are asked not to build anything overly large/permanent unless Kaddicus approves it. Smaller builds, concepts, and finishing previously started builds is OK.

## FAQ
- Are any Texture Packs/Shader Packs used for the City?

No textures are required, and typically none are used by the main builders. This ensures that above all the City looks good in Vanilla Minecraft, and does not rely on a Texture or Shader. If you really want to, you can use a Shader, but we suggest you leave textures as default textures.


- What style is the City/What are inspirations used?

Honestly this is a tough question, as we're mostly winging it. Inspiration comes from personal recollection of buildings we've seen in real life, as well as from google searches either for a certain type of building, or for that building in minecraft. We also use various Schematics as needed. For more on that see the Schematics header.

## Schematics
We use various Schematics, particularly for Trees, Shrubbery, and other Outdoor/Nature related needs. Schematics of Buildings and other large structures are credited in-game. Trees, Shrubbery and other Outdoor Terrain & Accessories schematic files are stored [here](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/CityPlans/tree/master/Schematics/Trees), and a detailed list of them is [here](https://github.com/KadTheHunter/CityPlans/blob/master/Schematics/Trees/TreesInfo.md).

## Ideas Generator
This is not how we're making the city look, just an image we use for ideas.
