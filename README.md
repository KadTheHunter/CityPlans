City Planning for Orion RolePlay &amp; Plots

Greetings life form!
If you've found this file, congrats, and welcome to the headquarters of the team who's working on building a brand new city for Orion RolePlay &amp; Plots

# Collaboration
If you want to help, open an issue titled "Write Access" and I'll see about adding you as a contributor/collaborator on this GitHub repo.
I (Clik), or Noah, will ask you some questions, and determine if you need/are allowed access to create, edit and add on to the files, or if we merely need to merge your ideas into the files ourselves.

# In-Game Building
If you want to apply to be a Builder, open an issue titled "Builder Access" and we will ask you some questions, and arrange a time to introduce you to the City itself.
All Builders we hire MUST have GitHub and Discord, so they are able to see current project lists, update statuses as needed, and communicate with the Owners and Staff when needed. Please do not waste your and our time applying if you do not have both GitHub and Discord accounts.
